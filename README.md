# My-C-Programs
This is a collection of amateur C program I have written.

1. Pointer Usage - Here I show some usage of pointers in C.

2. Bitmap image writer - This is a simple and amatuer C program that generates square bitmaps when run. Quite static. To get a different colored bitmap, you'd have to change the code. However, the size of the square can be changed through the parameter of the generate Square Bitmap function. This maybe terribly written but hey it is one of my first C programs.
